# Simulation, modeling and optimization project
This was a project I did for an optimization and modeling class. This is but a small part of the full thing. The classmate I was working with, decided to change everything at the last minute. I created this repo and I made all the code in here in order to share it quickly with my partner.

# How to use it
With this code you can't do much really. But if you want to use it just download the contents, open eclipse and import the project. There are no builds, and because of it there is no other way to use this code :/
